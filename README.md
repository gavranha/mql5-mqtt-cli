# A native MQTT client for MQL5

This code started as a companion for a series of articles about the MQTT 5.0 protocol we wrote for [mql5.com](https://mql5.com) website.

It is being developed on scarce free-time and it is **not** production-ready. 

Now, we realized that:

* MQTT 3.1.1 would be enough for getting started
* maybe the object-oriented approach was not the most smart decision

We'll continue developing it, as we want a native MQTT client to replace some DLL dependent code. But we are not MQL5 gurus, far away from that. So, any contribution is more than welcome.

The main goal now is to push it to a working state for MQTT 3.1.1.

# The articles

To better understand the context in which this code was written and why some choices were made the way they were, please take a look at some of the articles. 

In the Part 7 - final, you will find a working demo for a possible use case.
